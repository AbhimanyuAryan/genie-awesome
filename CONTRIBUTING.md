# Contributing Guide

1. Make sure you put all links necessary! (read below)
2. Always add your items to the end of a list. To be fair, the order is first-come-first-serve.
3. If you think something belongs in the wrong category, or think there needs to be a new category, feel free to edit things too.



### Example of addition:

```
[Project resource info](link to resource) by user@github
```
